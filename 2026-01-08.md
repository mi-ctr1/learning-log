**What I Learned**
- Odin Project: Continued Foundations course - Completed Git Basics
- Sophia Learning: Continued Unit 2.2 Intro to HTML

**Challenges**
- I made a mistake within my terminal and spent a good bit of time learning to back track and resolve the mistake I made during Git Basics. I created a folder within a folder and had to utilize basic commands such as lg, git status, git commit, git add, and git_test to correct my mistake.

**Next Steps**
- Odin Project: Continuing Foundations course | HTML Foundations
- Sophia Learning: Python Course Practice
